# osu! Akubo Player
My little osu!player for listenning without osu!client


How working? Choose path to osu! the program itself will finish path to \Songs folder


It is important that the "\Songs" folder is in "\ osu!\".


1.Can playing without button Play, just click to song in playlist .


2.This player using bass.dll, please don't delete this.



3.I think next ver will have a search mode.
